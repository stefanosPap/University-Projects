This project is an implementation of the discrete fast fourier transformation.

-step1,step2,step3 are three different implementations of fast fourier transformation and they are improved serially.
-demo1,demo2,demo3,demoproof are four scripts that are used to compare the results of the step1,step2,step3 functions with the fft() built-in function in matlab.
